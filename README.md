# QUESTION 1.
### a.
The median of an array of numbers is the element m of the array such that half the remaining
numbers in the array are greater than or equal to m and half are less than or equal to m, if the
number of elements in the array is odd. If the number of elements is even, the median is the
average of the two elements m1 and m2 such that half the remaining elements are greater than or
equal to m1 and m2, and half the elements are less than or equal to m1 and m2. Write a C++
function that accepts an array of numbers and returns the median of the numbers in the array, and
the corresponding program to test the function.

### b.
The mode of an array of numbers is the number **m** in the array that is repeated most frequently. If
more than one number is repeated with equal maximal frequencies, there is no mode.
Write a C++ function that accepts an array of numbers and returns the mode or an indication that the mode
does not exist, and the corresponding program to test the function.

### c.
Assume two arrays, one of student records and the other of employee records. Each student record
contains members for a last name, a first name, and average marks. Each employee record
contains members for a last name, a first name and a salary. Both arrays are ordered in
alphabetical order by last name and first name. Two records with same last name/first name do not
appear in the same array. Write a C++ function to give a 10% raise to every employee who has a
student record and whose average marks is greater than 60, and the corresponding program to test
the function.


# QUESTION 2.
### a.
Write a function that takes a word stored in a character array (an array of type char) as an
argument and repeatedly prints the word as many times as it has characters. Assume that the array
has the same length as the length of the word. A sample run is shown.
```
Word is "Hello"
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
Hello
```

# QUESTION 3.
### a.
Write a function that computes x<sup>n</sup> where x is a floating point number and n is a positive integer.
The function should check that n is positive. A loop must be used (recall, for example, x<sup>3</sup> = x * x * x) as opposed to Math functions. 
Two sample runs are shown.

```
x is 1.3, n is 5
  1.3 raised to the power 5 is: 3.71293
    ... and...
  x is 5.6, n is -3
n must be a positive integer
```

### b.
Write a function that returns the factorial of its integer argument stored in an array. The function
should use a loop for the calculation.

### c.
Write a function that takes an array of integers as an argument and prints out the contents of the
array. Your function should have the following format.
```
public static void example(int list[]) {
  /* This function prints out the contents of list[].*/
    // Your code here
```
